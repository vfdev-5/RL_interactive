# Reinforcement Learning *interactive* examples

A number of *jupyter notebooks* introducing basic reinforcement learning algorithms applied on toy models. Algorithms implementations, notations and terms follow ["Reinforcement learning - An introduction" book](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html).

## Requirements

* numpy/scipy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* jupyter-notebook

## Content

* Bridge crossing problem
    - Dynamic Programming algorithms (policy iteration, value iteration)
    - Monte Carlo methods (first-visit policy evalution, exploring starts, on-policy first-visit)
    - Temporal Difference algorithms (SARSA, Q-learning)
* Racecar problem
    - Monte Carlo Exploring Starts
